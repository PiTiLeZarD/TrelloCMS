# TrelloCRM

TrelloCRM is a concept for now. Just trying to suss out if I can use Trello and eleventy to generate a static website

For now, create a .env file with:

```
TRELLO_API_KEY=""
TRELLO_TOKEN=""
TRELLO_BOARD_ID=""
```

Get your key/token from https://trello.com/app-key

Then run

```
yarn trello
yarn 11ty --serve
```

Et voila!
